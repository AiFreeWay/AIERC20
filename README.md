# H1 Implementation of ERC20 token, extended emission functionality.
ERC-20 is a technical standard used to issue and implement tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It was proposed in November 2015 by Ethereum developer Fabian Vogelsteller. The standard describes a common set of rules that should be followed for a token to function properly within the Ethereum ecosystem.

Builded and tested with Solidity and Ethereum truffle.
